# Turkish Sort Algorithm Updates

## Current Implementation
The current implementation of the Turkish sort algorithm in `src/sort/turk_sort.c` works for stacks of up to 10 numbers. The algorithm uses indexes to optimize the sorting process, as described in `docs/turkish_sort.md`.

## Areas for Improvement
1. **Handling Larger Stacks**: The algorithm needs to be extended to handle stacks larger than 10 numbers.
2. **Index Assignment**: The index assignment process needs to be optimized for larger stacks.
3. **Target Finding**: The target finding functions need to be updated to handle larger stacks more efficiently.
4. **Push Selection**: The push selection strategy needs to be refined for larger stacks.
5. **Return Strategy**: The return strategy needs to be optimized for larger stacks.

## Proposed Changes
1. **Extend Index Assignment**: Modify the index assignment process to handle larger stacks more efficiently.
2. **Optimize Target Finding**: Update the target finding functions to handle larger stacks more efficiently.
3. **Refine Push Selection**: Refine the push selection strategy to handle larger stacks more efficiently.
4. **Optimize Return Strategy**: Update the return strategy to handle larger stacks more efficiently.
5. **Testing**: Implement comprehensive testing to ensure the algorithm works correctly for stacks of various sizes.

## Next Steps
1. Review the current implementation and identify specific areas for improvement.
2. Implement the proposed changes and test them thoroughly.
3. Document the updated algorithm and its optimizations.
